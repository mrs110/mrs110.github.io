                <p>
                    The Insurance Service Hub is a platform providing a variety of services to German, Austrian and Swiss insurance companies. Three of these services come in the form of mobile applications which aim to simplify the communication between insurance companies and the assured.
                    I have contributed to the development, delivery, roadmap and user experience of  these apps. During the development I helped setup automatic testing. Then I moved into delivering the apps to insurance companies, working on client site. I identified new product features and discussed these with clients, development teams and potential users. I have shaped the user experience, discussing usability with our design teams and developers. 
                    I am now a project leader coordinating work on client projects concerned with mobile apps and advising on their mobile strategy

                <p>
                    Let‘sTalk is a Chile-based startup revolutionizing the way customers interact with service providers. It moves the interaction between the two parties away from calls and into instant messaging. 
                    I joined the small startup team as a developer for the web application which was designed to be the service’s entry point for service provider operators. I identified and implemented features that improved the operators’  user experience, such as information aggregation for a user (on the right of the screenshot), fast responses (open list view at the center) and replies by email that seamlessly appeared in the chat history. 
                    I received immediate feedback on new features by our users, which helped me improve existing or envision new features for the product roadmap.
                    In addition, I helped shape the company’s privacy policy and strategy.

                <p>
                    Cobra is a tool for engineers at Dialog Semiconductor with which they can quickly record and analyze live data coming from their ARM-based power management micro-chips. The user can easily compare current with historic data using drag and drop features to align, scale and select data plots. The results can then be saved in CSV format.
                    I was given full autonomy to build Cobra. I started by asking future users to guide me through their data capturing and analysis process. I tried to identify their pain points and found creative ways to solve them. I presented new features and collected feedback in order to improve the user experience. As of January 2017 the tool is still in use, showing that I have succeeded in building a helpful product that users want to use .
                    I developed the application using Python‘s PyQt library. I also contributed the firmware running on the micro-chips.
